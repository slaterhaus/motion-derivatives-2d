# Derivatives of Motion Visualization
This project provides a simple and intuitive visualization of four derivatives of motion: position, velocity, acceleration, and jounce. 
It uses Chart.js to animate the transitions between randomly generated data sets, representing each derivative as a distinct line on the graph. The data sets are updated every 10 seconds to provide a dynamic visualization experience.

Ideal for learning and teaching purposes, this project brings abstract concepts in physics and calculus to life. Whether you're a student trying to grasp these concepts or an educator looking for a compelling teaching tool, this project offers a playful yet profound way to understand the complex world of motion.
